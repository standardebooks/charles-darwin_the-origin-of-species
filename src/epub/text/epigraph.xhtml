				<p>“The only distinct meaning of the word ‘natural’ is <b>stated</b>, <b>fixed</b> or <b>settled</b>; since what is natural as much requires and presupposes an intelligent agent to render it so, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr>, to effect it continually or at stated times, as what is supernatural or miraculous does to effect it for once.”</p>

				<p>“To conclude, therefore, let no man out of a weak conceit of sobriety, or an ill-applied moderation, think or maintain, that a man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of God’s word, or in the book of God’s works; divinity or philosophy; but rather let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in both.”</p>
